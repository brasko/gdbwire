# This script creates the amalgamation files, gdbwire.h and gdbwire.c.
#
# The build system passes this script the gdbwire version, the
# root to the source directory and the root to the build directory.
# This script finds the appropriate files and copies them into 
# the temporary build directory, src/amalgamation/tsrc. The
# easiest way to create this directory is to configure with
# --enable-amalgamation enabled and to do a build of gdbwire with
# the 'make' build command. Note that some of the copied header
# and source files are generated from flex and bison.
#
# After the "tsrc" directory has been created and populated, the build
# system runs the script:
#
#      python mkgdbwire.py package_version abs_source_path abs_build_path
#
# The amalgamated gdbwire code will be written into gdbwire.h and gdbwire.c.

# consistancy in the amalgamation output files. The files will always
# be processed in the same order. The second is, it provides a safety
# check to always ensure that known files are included in the amalgamation.
#
# This means if an include or source file is added to automake, it will
# also have to be updated here as well.
